  abstract = {Two genuinely quantum mechanical models for an antiferromagnetic linear chain with nearest neighbor interactions are constructed and solved exactly, in the sense that the ground state, all the elementary excitations and the free energy are found. A general formalism for calculating the instantaneous correlation between any two spins is developed and applied to the investigation of short- and long-range order. Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter {$\lambda$} which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determining long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin 12 systems having rather general isotropic Heisenberg interactions favoring an antiferromagnetic ordering, the ground state is nondegenerate and there is no energy gap above the ground state in the energy spectrum of the total system.},

  abstract = {A quantum Monte Carlo simulation scheme for spin systems is presented. The method is a generalization of Handscomb's method but applicable to any length of the spin, i.e., when the spin traces cannot be evaluated analytically. The Monte Carlo sampling is extended to the space of spin vectors in addition to the usual operator-index sequences. An important technical point is that the index sequences are augmented with the aid of unit operators to a constant, self-consistently determined length. The scheme is applied to the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin-S Heisenberg model. Results at low temperatures are reported for S=1 and S=3/2 and system sizes up to N=64. The computed magnetic structure factor in the S=1 chain is in agreement with earlier ground-state calculations. For S=3/2 we find the exponent {$\gamma$}\textasciimacron{}=0.49{$\pm$}0.04 for the divergence of the antiferromagnetic structure factor. Further, the susceptibility as a function of the wave number is computed. For S=1 the staggered susceptibility {$\chi$}({$\pi$}) at T=0 is found to take the value 20.0{$\pm$}1.5 in units such that {$\chi$}(q)\textrightarrowT-1 at high temperatures (with the temperature scale defined by kB=1).

The distribution of the low-lying energy levels of the system is studied with the aid of a numerical program. The results of this investigation suggest a simple picture of independent spins and small-size clusters of spins flipping in a frozen-random-background field. This picure is similar to the phenomenological description of amorphous materials in terms of two-level systems. Distributions of the quantities which characterize a low-lying energy state in this picture are obtained numerically. A crude analytic calculation of these distributions is also included. These distributions are then used to calculate various low-temperature dynamic properties such as the time-dependent susceptibility, relaxation of the magnetization in an external magnetic field, and the remanent magnetization. We find that this simple description provides qualitative explanations of a large number of results obtained in previous Monte Carlo simulations.},

One kind of computation for which massively parallel networks appear to be well suited is large constraint satisfaction searches, but to use the connections efficiently two conditions must be met: First, a search technique that is suitable for parallel networks must be found. Second, there must be some way of choosing internal representations which allow the preexisting hardware connections to be used efficiently for encoding the constraints in the domain being searched. We describe a general parallel search method, based on statistical mechanics, and we show how it leads to a general learning rule for modifying the connection strengths so as to incorporate knowledge about a task domain in an efficient way. We describe some simple examples in which the learning algorithm creates internal representations that are demonstrably the most efficient way of using the preexisting connectivity structure.},

We therefore conclude that a recent proposal for dealing with the sign problem due to Sorella et al. Leads to an uncontrolled approximation. In the cases we have studied it is a good approximation for the ground-state energy, and we present a method for calculating the correction needed to make it exact.

This way of combining individual ``expert'' models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called ``contrastive divergence'' whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data.},

  abstract = {I attempt to give a pedagogical overview of the progress which has occurred during the past decade in the description of one-dimensional correlated fermions. Fermi liquid theory based on a quasi-particle picture, breaks down in one dimension because of the Peierls divergence and because of charge-spin separation. It is replaced by a Luttinger liquid whose elementary excitations are collective charge and spin modes, based on the exactly solvable Luttinger model. I review this model and various solutions with emphasis on bosonization (and its equivalence to conformal field theory), and its physical properties. The notion of a Luttinger liquid implies that all gapless 1D systems share these properties at low energies. Chapters 1 and 2 of the article contain an introduction and a discussion of the breakdown of Fermi liquid theory. Chapter 3 describes in detail the solution of the Luttinger model both by bosonization and by Green's functions methods and summarizes the properties of the model, expressed thorugh correlation functions. The relation to conformal field theory is discussed. Chapter 4 of the article introduces the notion of a Luttinger liquid. It describes in much detail the various mappings applied to realistic models of 1D correlated fermions, onto the Luttinger model, as well as important corrections to the Luttinger model properties discussed in Ch.3. Chapter 5 describes situations where the Luttinger liquid is not a stable fixed point, and where spin or charge gaps open in at least one channel. Chapter 6 discusses multi-band and multichain problems, in particular the stability of a Luttinger liquid with respect to interchain hopping. Ch. 7 gives a brief summary of experimental efforts to uncover Luttinger liquid correlations in quasi-1D materials.},

This notion is supported by the fact that it is not known how to express the partition function in a sign-free manner in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations for a large number of important problems. The answer to the question\textemdash{}whether there is a fundamental obstruction to such a sign-free representation in generic quantum systems\textemdash{}remains unclear. Focusing on systems with bosonic degrees of freedom, we show that quantized gravitational responses appear as obstructions to local sign-free QMC. In condensed matter physics settings, these responses, such as thermal Hall conductance, are associated with fractional quantum Hall effects. We show that similar arguments also hold in the case of spontaneously broken time-reversal (TR) symmetry such as in the chiral phase of a perturbed quantum Kagome antiferromagnet. The connection between quantized gravitational responses and the sign problem is also manifested in certain vertex models, where TR symmetry is preserved.

We consider the level of volcanic activity on a planet to be a function of the planet's thermodynamic state. A planet is considered to become volcanically inactive once it has reached a thermodynamic steady state. We first model the heat flow in the planet's interior by the heat equation, which we reduce to a one-dimensional Laplace equation. We then calculate the temperature field of the planet by numerically solving a spherically symmetric boundary value problem. Finally, we relate discrete time-steps in our simulation to real-time via an empirically-informed mapping. Our results indicate that Earth will remain volcanically active for a total of {$\sim$}6.0\textbackslash{}sim 6.0 billion years since its formation, while Earth-like planets of 0.50.5 and 2.02.0 Earth masses will be active for {$\sim$}5.5\textbackslash{}sim 5.5 and {$\sim$}7.7\textbackslash{}sim 7.7 billion years respectively. Our model incorrectly predicts that Earth-like planets above 2.02.0 Earth masses continually increase their internal temperatures if their conductivity and density profiles are assumed to be identical to that of Earth, which suggests some limitations of the model.},

The wavefunction at infinite interaction, and the projector, are represented in coordinate space, leading to an expression for expectation values which can be evaluated via Monte Carlo sampling.

In mVMC, we introduce more than ten thousands variational parameters and simultaneously optimize them by using the stochastic reconfiguration (SR) method. In this paper, we explain basics and user interfaces of mVMC. By using mVMC, users can perform the calculation by preparing only one input file of about ten lines for widely studied quantum lattice models, and can also perform it for general Hamiltonians by preparing several additional input files. We show the benchmark results of mVMC for the Hubbard model, the Heisenberg model, and the Kondo-lattice model. These benchmark results demonstrate that mVMC provides ground-state and low-energy-excited-state wave functions for interacting fermion systems with high accuracy.

Using the quantum Monte-Carlo technique, the scaling theory of quantum critical phenomena and the mapping to the XY model we investigate the critical properties along the temperature, band filling and coupling strength axes of the phase diagram. Particular emphasis is devoted to the insulator to superconductor and superconductor to normal metal transitions driven by the variation of the coupling strength U. We also discuss the particular similarities between this simple lattice model and the high-Tc cuprates: both systems exhibit a phase transition along a certain critical line as a function of a particular control parameter, which is e.g. the strength of the attractive coupling |U| in the case of the Hubbard model and the electron doping in the copper oxide planes for the cuprates; both show a remarkable crossover along this phase transition line with similar consequences. At one end point (overdoped/small-U regime) we find a behavior similar to a conventional BCS-type superconductor, the system undergoes a normal metal to superconductor transition (NS), whereas at the other end (underdoped/large-U limit) a description in terms of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of preformed pairs is more adequate, with a superconductor to insulator critical endpoint (SI). There superconductivity occurs when the phases of the pairs become coherent, not when the pairs are initially formed. In addition to the fixed electron density, interaction driven crossover the Hubbard model undergoes a further T=0 quantum transition from a (super-) conductor to an insulator for {$\rho\rightarrow$}0{$\rho\rightarrow$}0\textbackslash{}rho \textbackslash{}to 0.},

  abstract = {Machine learning, one of today's most rapidly growing interdisciplinary fields, promises an unprecedented perspective for solving intricate quantum many-body problems. Understanding the physical aspects of the representative artificial neural-network states has recently become highly desirable in the applications of machine-learning techniques to quantum many-body physics. In this paper, we explore the data structures that encode the physical features in the network states by studying the quantum entanglement properties, with a focus on the restricted-Boltzmann-machine (RBM) architecture. We prove that the entanglement entropy of all short-range RBM states satisfies an area law for arbitrary dimensions and bipartition geometry. For long-range RBM states, we show by using an exact construction that such states could exhibit volume-law entanglement, implying a notable capability of RBM in representing quantum states with massive entanglement. Strikingly, the neural-network representation for these states is remarkably efficient, in the sense that the number of nonzero parameters scales only linearly with the system size. We further examine the entanglement properties of generic RBM states by randomly sampling the weight parameters of the RBM. We find that their averaged entanglement entropy obeys volume-law scaling, and the meantime strongly deviates from the Page entropy of the completely random pure states. We show that their entanglement spectrum has no universal part associated with random matrix theory and bears a Poisson-type level statistics. Using reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that RBM is capable of finding the ground state (with power-law entanglement) of a model Hamiltonian with a long-range interaction. In addition, we show, through a concrete example of the one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological cluster states, that the RBM representation may also be used as a tool to analytically compute the entanglement spectrum. Our results uncover the unparalleled power of artificial neural networks in representing quantum many-body states regardless of how much entanglement they possess, which paves a novel way to bridge computer-science-based machine-learning techniques to outstanding quantum condensed-matter physics problems.},

  abstract = {We compare and contrast the statistical physics and quantum physics inspired approaches for unsupervised generative modeling of classical data. The two approaches represent probabilities of observed data using energy-based models and quantum states, respectively. Classical and quantum information patterns of the target datasets therefore provide principled guidelines for structural design and learning in these two approaches. Taking the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) as an example, we analyze the information theoretical bounds of the two approaches. We also estimate the classical mutual information of the standard MNIST datasets and the quantum R\&eacute;nyi entropy of corresponding Matrix Product States (MPS) representations. Both information measures are much smaller compared to their theoretical upper bound and exhibit similar patterns, which imply a common inductive bias of low information complexity. By comparing the performance of RBM with various architectures on the standard MNIST datasets, we found that the RBM with local sparse connection exhibit high learning efficiency, which supports the application of tensor network states in machine learning problems.},

  abstract = {We consider wavefunctions which are non-negative in some tensor product basis. We study what possible teleportation can occur in such wavefunctions, giving a complete answer in some cases (when one system is a qubit) and partial answers elsewhere. We use this to show that a one-dimensional wavefunction which is non-negative and has zero correlation length can be written in a ``coherent Gibbs state'' form, as explained later. We conjecture that such holds in higher dimensions. Additionally, some results are provided on possible teleportation in general wavefunctions, explaining how Schmidt coefficients before measurement limit the possible Schmidt coefficients after measurement, and on the absence of a ``generalized area law'' [D. Aharonov et al., in Proceedings of Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) (IEEE, 2014), p. 246; e-print arXiv.org:1410.0951] even for Hamiltonians with no sign problem. One of the motivations for this work is an attempt to prove a conjecture about ground state wavefunctions which have an ``intrinsic'' sign problem that cannot be removed by any quantum circuit. We show a weaker version of this, showing that the sign problem is intrinsic for commuting Hamiltonians in the same phase as the double semion model under the technical assumption that TQO-2 holds [S. Bravyi et al., J. Math. Phys. 51, 093512 (2010)].},

For odd d the theory is related to the toric code by a local unitary transformation, but for even d the dimension of the space of zero energy ground states is in general different from the toric code and for even d{$>$}2d{$>$}2\{d {$>$} 2\} it is also in general different from that of the twisted Z2Z2\{Z\_2\} Dijkgraaf\textendash{}Witten model.},

  title = {Computational {{Methods}} for the {{Measurement}} of {{Entanglement}} in {{Condensed Matter Systems}}},
  abstract = {At the interface of quantum information and condensed matter physics, the study of entanglement in quantum many-body systems requires a new toolset which combines concepts from each. This thesis introduces a set of computational methods to study phases and phase transitions in lattice models of quantum systems, using the Renyi entropies as a means of quantifying entanglement. The scaling of entanglement entropy can give valuable insight into the phase of a condensed matter system. It can be used to detect exotic types of phases, to pinpoint transitions between phases, and can give us universal information about a system. 
The first approach in this thesis is a technique to measure entanglement in finite size 
lattice systems using zero-temperature quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The algorithm 
is developed, implemented, and used to explore anomalous entanglement scaling terms in 
the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet. 
In the second part of this thesis, a new and complementary numerical technique is introduced to study entanglement not just in finite size systems, but as we approach the thermodynamic limit. This ``numerical linked-cluster expansion'' is used to study two different systems at their quantum critical points \textemdash{} continuous phase transitions occurring at zero temperature, at which these systems exhibit universal properties. Remarkably, these universal properties can be reflected in the scaling of entanglement. 
Entanglement offers a new perspective on condensed matter systems, one which takes us closer to genuinely understanding what goes on in these materials at the quantum mechanical level. This thesis demonstrates the first steps in developing an extensive list of computational tools that can be used to study entanglement over a wide range of interacting quantum many-body systems. With the ever increasing computational power available, it may be only a matter of time before these tools are used to create a comprehensive framework for the characterization of condensed matter phases and phase transitions.},

  title = {Simulating Quantum Matter through Lattice Field Theories},
  abstract = {Quantum many-body systems are comprised of complex networks of microscopic interactions that work together to produce novel collective phases and phenomena. 
For strongly-interacting systems, the connection between the underlying atomic-scale behaviour and the resulting emergent observable phenomena is exponentially (and, in practice, infinitely) complicated such that it becomes impossible to fully understand the connection between the physics at the microscopic and macroscopic levels. 
The most promising theoretical approaches to addressing this infinite complexity utilize microscopic coarse-graining along with powerful computational simulations and strategies. 
In this thesis, we apply numerical methods to effective lattice models and field theories with the goal of shedding light onto universal critical behaviour and exotic low-temperature phases in condensed matter physics. 
 
We start by exploring universal features of critical non-interacting systems, for which several analytical strategies are readily available for calculating certain observables. 
We study the behaviour of the system's entanglement for various entangling geometries, and utilize numerical techniques in order to isolate new universal features of Gaussian fixed points, which provide insight into the underlying critical theory's renormalization group flow. 
We then proceed to examine computational strategies and, in particular, Monte Carlo simulations for studying more general interacting models. 
We focus on the application of such strategies to the field of high-temperature superconductivity, for which we develop a coarse-grained model, simulate macroscopic observables and compare our results with those of recent experiments. 
We conclude that lattice field theories together with innovative computational methods offer new perspectives on both universality and emergent phenomena in quantum matter.},

  abstract = {Differential evolution (DE) has been applied extensively in drug combination optimization studies in the past decade. It allows for identification of desired drug combinations with minimal experimental effort. This article proposes an adaptive population-sizing method for the DE algorithm. Our new method presents improvements in terms of efficiency and convergence over the original DE algorithm and constant stepwise population reduction\textendash{}based DE algorithm, which would lead to a reduced number of cells and animals required to identify an optimal drug combination. The method continuously adjusts the reduction of the population size in accordance with the stage of the optimization process. Our adaptive scheme limits the population reduction to occur only at the exploitation stage. We believe that continuously adjusting for a more effective population size during the evolutionary process is the major reason for the significant improvement in the convergence speed of the DE algorithm. The performance of the method is evaluated through a set of unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. In combining with self-adaptive schemes for mutation and crossover constants, this adaptive population reduction method can help shed light on the future direction of a completely parameter tune-free self-adaptive DE algorithm.},

This is why adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted so much attention, as it provided a new approach to tackle NP-complete problems using a quantum computer. The efficiency of this approach is limited by small spectral gaps between the ground and excited states of the quantum computer's Hamiltonian. We show that the statistics of the gaps can be analyzed in a novel way, borrowed from the study of quantum disordered systems in statistical mechanics. It turns out that due to a phenomenon similar to Anderson localization, exponentially small gaps appear close to the end of the adiabatic algorithm for large random instances of NP-complete problems. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization fails: The system gets trapped in one of the numerous local minima.},

This is an idealized limit of attractive fermions where the range of the interaction is zero and the scattering length is infinite. Using Euclidean time projection, we compute the ground state energy using four computationally different but physically identical auxiliary-field methods. The best performance is obtained using a bounded continuous auxiliary field and a nonlocal updating algorithm called the hybrid Monte Carlo. With this method, we calculate results for 10 and 14 fermions at lattice volumes 43,53,63,73,83 and extrapolate to the continuum limit. For 10 fermions in a periodic cube, the ground state energy is 0.292(12) times the ground state energy for noninteracting fermions. For 14 fermions, the ratio is 0.329(5).},

  abstract = {The recently introduced self-learning Monte Carlo method is a general-purpose numerical method that speeds up Monte Carlo simulations by training an effective model to propose uncorrelated configurations in the Markov chain. We implement this method in the framework of a continuous-time Monte Carlo method with an auxiliary field in quantum impurity models. We introduce and train a diagram generating function (DGF) to model the probability distribution of auxiliary field configurations in continuous imaginary time, at all orders of diagrammatic expansion. By using DGF to propose global moves in configuration space, we show that the self-learning continuous-time Monte Carlo method can significantly reduce the computational complexity of the simulation.},

The method is based on successive applications of an evolving Hamiltonian to an initial state and delivers results for a whole range of the tuning parameter in a single run, allowing for access to both static and dynamic properties of the system. This approach reduces to the standard Schr{\"o}dinger dynamics in imaginary time for quasi-adiabatic evolutions, i.e., including the leading nonadiabatic correction to the adiabatic limit. We here demonstrate this quasi-adiabatic QMC (QAQMC) method for linear ramps of the transverse-field Ising model across its quantum-critical point in one and two dimensions. The critical behavior can be described by generalized dynamic scaling. For the two-dimensional square-lattice system, we use the method to obtain a high-precision estimate of the quantum-critical point (h/J)c=3.04458(7), where h is the transverse magnetic field and J is the nearest-neighbor Ising coupling. The QAQMC method can also be used to extract the Berry curvature and the metric tensor.},

  abstract = {We introduce the concept of directed loops in stochastic series expansion and path integral quantum Monte Carlo methods. Using the detailed balance rules for directed loops, we show that it is possible to smoothly connect generally applicable simulation schemes (in which it is necessary to include back-tracking processes in the loop construction) to more restricted loop algorithms that can be constructed only for a limited range of Hamiltonians (where back-tracking can be avoided). The "algorithmic discontinuities" between general and special points (or regions) in parameter space can hence be eliminated. As a specific example, we consider the anisotropic S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet in an external magnetic field. We show that directed loop simulations are very efficient for the full range of magnetic fields (zero to the saturation point) and anisotropies. In particular for weak fields and anisotropies, the autocorrelations are significantly reduced relative to those of previous approaches. The back-tracking probability vanishes continuously as the isotropic Heisenberg point is approached. For the XY-model, we show that back-tracking can be avoided for all fields extending up to the saturation field. The method is hence particularly efficient in this case. We use directed loop simulations to study the magnetization process in the 2D Heisenberg model at very low temperatures. For LxL lattices with L up to 64, we utilize the step-structure in the magnetization curve to extract gaps between different spin sectors. Finite-size scaling of the gaps gives an accurate estimate of the transverse susceptibility in the thermodynamic limit: chi\_perp = 0.0659 +- 0.0002.},

  abstract = {This Chapter outlines the fundamental construction of the Stochastic Series Expansion, a highly efficient and easily implementable quantum Monte Carlo method for quantum lattice models. Originally devised as a finite-temperature simulation based on a Taylor expansion of the partition function, the method has recently been recast in the formalism of a zero-temperature projector method, where a large power of the Hamiltonian is applied to a trial wavefunction to project out the groundstate. Although these two methods appear formally quite different, their implementation via non-local loop or cluster algorithms reveals their underlying fundamental similarity. Here, we briefly review the finite- and zero-temperature formalisms, and discuss concrete manifestations of the algorithm for the spin 1/2 Heisenberg and transverse field Ising models.},

Our findings support the choice of evolution ansatz in the recently proposed quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Focusing on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass as an example, we find a system-size independent distribution of the duration of pulses, with characteristic time scale set by the inverse of the coupling constants in the Hamiltonian. The optimality of the bang-bang protocols and the characteristic time scale of the pulses provide an efficient parametrization of the protocol and inform the search for effective hybrid (classical and quantum) schemes for tackling combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, we find that the success rates of our optimal bang-bang protocols remain high even in the presence of weak external noise and coupling to a thermal bath.},

We review developmental evidence that children make use of hierarchically composed structures (`Merge') from the earliest stages and at all levels of linguistic organization. At the same time, longitudinal trajectories of development show sensitivity to the quantity of specific patterns in the input, which suggests the use of probabilistic processes as well as inductive learning mechanisms that are suitable for the psychological constraints on language acquisition. By considering the place of language in human biology and evolution, we propose an approach that integrates principles from Universal Grammar and constraints from other domains of cognition. We outline some initial results of this approach as well as challenges for future research.},

To address this discrepancy, a quantum-classical hybrid optimization scheme known as `the quantum variational eigensolver' was developed (Peruzzo et al 2014 Nat. Commun. 5 4213) with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through a relaxation of exponential operator splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.},

In particular, simulating properties of encoded circuits is a crucial tool for investigating the relationship between properties such as the noise model, encoding scheme, and threshold value. For general noisy circuits, these simulations quickly become intractable in the size of the encoded circuit. We introduce a general theoretical method for approximating a noise process by one that allows for efficient Monte Carlo simulation of properties of encoded circuits. The approximation is as close to the original process as possible without overestimating its ability to preserve quantum information, a key property for obtaining honest estimates of threshold values. We numerically illustrate the method with various physically relevant noise models.},

This method has been tested extensively for a strongly correlated model like the t-J model. With the standard Lanczos technique it is possible to compute any kind of correlation functions, with no particular computational effort. By using that the variance \$-\^2\$ is zero for an exact eigenstate, we show that the approach to the exact solution with few Lanczos ite rations is indeed possible even for \$\textbackslash{}sim 100\$ electrons for reasonably good initial wavefunctions.The variational stochastic reconfiguration technique presented here allows in general a many-parameter energy optimization of any computable many-body wavefunction, including for inst ance generic long range Jastrow factors and arbitrary site dependent orbital determinants.

  abstract = {Conventional methods for computing maximum-likelihood estimators (MLE) often converge slowly in practical situations, leading to a search for simplifying methods that rely on additional assumptions for their validity. In this work, we provide a fast and reliable algorithm for maximum likelihood reconstruction that avoids this slow convergence. Our method utilizes the state-of-the-art convex optimization scheme---an accelerated projected-gradient method---that allows one to accommodate the quantum nature of the problem in a different way than in the standard methods. We demonstrate the power of our approach by comparing its performance with other algorithms for n-qubit state tomography. In particular, an 8-qubit situation that purportedly took weeks of computation time in 2005 can now be completed in under a minute for a single set of data, with far higher accuracy than previously possible. This refutes the common claim that MLE reconstruction is slow, and reduces the need for alternative methods that often come with difficult-to-verify assumptions. In fact, recent methods assuming Gaussian statistics or relying on compressed sensing ideas are demonstrably inapplicable for the situation under consideration here. Our algorithm can be applied to general optimization problems over the quantum state space; the philosophy of projected gradients can further be utilized for optimization contexts with general constraints.},

We characterize this source using two detection methods, one based on photon-counting analysis, and the second using homodyne tomography to reconstruct the density matrix and Wigner function of the state. The latter technique allows us to completely determine the mode of the retrieved photon in its fine phase and amplitude details, and demonstrate its nonclassical field statistics by observing a negative Wigner function. We measure a photon retrieval efficiency up to 82\% and an atomic memory coherence time of 900 ns. This setup is very well suited to study interactions between atomic excitations, and to use them in order to create and manipulate more sophisticated quantum states of light with a high degree of experimental control.},

In the last couple of years, researchers investigated if quantum computing can help to improve classical machine learning algorithms. Ideas range from running computationally costly algorithms or their subroutines efficiently on a quantum computer to the translation of stochastic methods into the language of quantum theory. This contribution gives a systematic overview of the emerging field of quantum machine learning. It presents the approaches as well as technical details in an accessible way, and discusses the potential of a future theory of quantum learning.},

  abstract = {The preparation of quantum states using short quantum circuits is one of the most promising near-term applications of small quantum computers, especially if the circuit is short enough and the fidelity of gates high enough that it can be executed without quantum error correction. Such quantum state preparation can be used in variational approaches, optimizing parameters in the circuit to minimize the energy of the constructed quantum state for a given problem Hamiltonian. For this purpose we propose a simple-to-implement class of quantum states motivated by adiabatic state preparation. We test its accuracy and determine the required circuit depth for a Hubbard model on ladders with up to 12 sites (24 spin orbitals), and for small molecules. We find that this ansatz converges faster than previously proposed schemes based on unitary coupled clusters. While the required number of measurements is astronomically large for quantum chemistry applications to molecules, applying the variational approach to the Hubbard model (and related models) is found to be far less demanding and potentially practical on small quantum computers. We also discuss another application of quantum state preparation using short quantum circuits, to prepare trial ground states of models faster than using adiabatic state preparation.},

In contrast to previous studies, in which a functional form for h(x,y) was assumed, we here optimize all the amplitudes for lattices with up to 32\texttimes{}32 spins. We use two different schemes for optimizing the amplitudes; a Newton conjugate-gradient method and a stochastic method which requires only the signs of the first derivatives of the energy. The latter method performs significantly better. The energy for large systems deviates by only {$\approx$}0.06\% from its exact value (calculated using unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations). The spin correlations are also well reproduced, falling {$\approx$}2\% below the exact ones at long distances (corresponding to an {$\approx$}1\% underestimation of the sublattice magnetization). The amplitudes h(r) for valence bonds of long length r decay as r-3. We also discuss some results for small frustrated lattices.},

Using a machine learning approach, we chose a ``training set'' of instances and optimized the parameters to produce a large overlap for the training set. We then tested these optimized parameters on a larger instance set. As a training set, we used a subset of the hard instances studied by Crosson, Farhi, C. Y.-Y. Lin, H.-H. Lin, and P. Shor (CFLLS) (arXiv:1401.7320). When tested, on the full set, the parameters that we find produce a significantly larger overlap than the optimized annealing times of CFLLS. Testing on other random instances from 20 to 28 bits continues to show improvement over annealing, with the improvement being most notable on the hardest instances. Further tests on instances of MAX-3-SAT also showed improvement on the hardest instances. This algorithm may be a possible application for near-term quantum computers with limited coherence times.},

The trained Boltzmann machine is then used to generate spin states, for which we compare thermodynamic observables to those computed by direct MC sampling. We demonstrate that the Boltzmann machine can faithfully reproduce the observables of the physical system.

  abstract = {We propose a deep learning method for single image super-resolution (SR). Our method directly learns an end-to-end mapping between the low/high-resolution images. The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution one. We further show that traditional sparse-coding-based SR methods can also be viewed as a deep convolutional network. But unlike traditional methods that handle each component separately, our method jointly optimizes all layers. Our deep CNN has a lightweight structure, yet demonstrates state-of-the-art restoration quality, and achieves fast speed for practical on-line usage. We explore different network structures and parameter settings to achieve trade-offs between performance and speed. Moreover, we extend our network to cope with three color channels simultaneously, and show better overall reconstruction quality.},

Within this model, we observe phase transitions into spatially ordered states that break various discrete symmetries, verify the high-fidelity preparation of these states and investigate the dynamics across the phase transition in large arrays of atoms. In particular, we observe robust many-body dynamics corresponding to persistent oscillations of the order after a rapid quantum quench that results from a sudden transition across the phase boundary.

  abstract = {Quantum computers can be used to address electronic-structure problems and problems in materials science and condensed matter physics that can be formulated as interacting fermionic problems, problems which stretch the limits of existing high-performance computers1. Finding exact solutions to such problems numerically has a computational cost that scales exponentially with the size of the system, and Monte Carlo methods are unsuitable owing to the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made solving even few-atom electronic-structure problems interesting for implementation using medium-sized quantum computers. Yet experimental implementations have so far been restricted to molecules involving only hydrogen and helium2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we demonstrate the experimental optimization of Hamiltonian problems with up to six qubits and more than one hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground-state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to BeH2. We achieve this result by using a variational quantum eigenvalue solver (eigensolver) with efficiently prepared trial states that are tailored specifically to the interactions that are available in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians9 and a robust stochastic optimization routine10. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying it to a problem of quantum magnetism, an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in an external magnetic field. In all cases, we find agreement between our experiments and numerical simulations using a model of the device with noise. Our results help to elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems and for bridging the gap between key problems in high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.},

It is based on the deep Boltzmann machine architecture, in which two layers of hidden neurons mediate quantum correlations among physical degrees of freedom in the visible layer. The approach reproduces the exact imaginary-time Hamiltonian evolution, and is completely deterministic. In turn, compact and exact network representations for the ground states are obtained without stochastic optimization of the network parameters. The number of neurons grows linearly with the system size and total imaginary time, respectively. Physical quantities can be measured by sampling configurations of both physical and neuron degrees of freedom. We provide specific examples for the transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg models by implementing efficient sampling. As a compact, classical representation for many-body quantum systems, our approach is an alternative to the standard path integral, and it is potentially useful also to systematically improve on numerical approaches based on the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture.},

  volume = {5},

  abstract = {In traditional single image super-resolution (SR) methods based on dictionary model, a large number of image features are needed to train the SR dictionary. In general, these features are extracted by artificial rules, such as pixel gray, gradient, and texture structure. But, the dictionary model trained by these artificial features or their combinations has exhibited poor expression especially for the images with complex and rich structures. Therefore, how to improve the dictionary expression ability and make the dictionary have more accurate description of the image features is a problem worthy of further study. In this paper, based on the advantage of dictionary training and deep learning, a new method of single image SR based on deep learning features and dictionary model is proposed. The new algorithm contains three steps. First, the features of high-resolution and low-resolution training images are extracted by a Kernel deep learning network. Second, in the sparse representation of SR framework, the dictionary model is trained by these deep learning features. Finally, an LR image SR is completed. Theoretical analysis show that the dictionary trained by deep learning features can improve in the ability to express image complex structure and texture, and it has more advantage than traditional artificial features dictionary. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can produce good SR visual results than the comparison algorithm, such as Bicubic, sparse coding super-resolution, and super-resolution convolutional neural network. And the peak signal to noise ratio and structural similarity index measurement are improved, the Computation Time is also reasonable.},

As it becomes possible to exert more control over larger numbers of qubits, such simulators will be able to tackle a wider range of problems, such as materials design and molecular modelling, with the ultimate limit being a universal quantum computer that can solve general classes of hard problems3. Here we use a quantum simulator composed of up to 53 qubits to study non-equilibrium dynamics in the transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions. We observe a dynamical phase transition after a sudden change of the Hamiltonian, in a regime in which conventional statistical mechanics does not apply4. The qubits are represented by the spins of trapped ions, which can be prepared in various initial pure states. We apply a global long-range Ising interaction with controllable strength and range, and measure each individual qubit with an efficiency of nearly 99 per cent. Such high efficiency means that arbitrary many-body correlations between qubits can be measured in a single shot, enabling the dynamical phase transition to be probed directly and revealing computationally intractable features that rely on the long-range interactions and high connectivity between qubits.},

We devise efficient algorithms to translate an RBM into the commonly used TNS. Conversely, we give sufficient and necessary conditions to determine whether a TNS can be transformed into an RBM of given architectures. Revealing these general and constructive connections can cross fertilize both deep learning and quantum many-body physics. Notably, by exploiting the entanglement entropy bound of TNS, we can rigorously quantify the expressive power of RBM on complex data sets. Insights into TNS and its entanglement capacity can guide the design of more powerful deep learning architectures. On the other hand, RBM can represent quantum many-body states with fewer parameters compared to TNS, which may allow more efficient classical simulations.},

  abstract = {One of the main quests of many-body physics and quantum information is to understand various quantum phases and in particular the entanglement present in them. In this work we have uncovered a unique, physically transparent quantum phase transition in a spin chain where entanglement entropy itself jumps from low scaling, most typical for gapped models and short-range correlations, to a critical phase where the scaling exhibits an extraordinary amount of entanglement. This discovery pushes the boundaries of a possible range of nonlocal quantum correlations displayed by local Hamiltonians and opens a door to fundamental and practical questions about the interplay of entanglement and locality in many-body systems., The nature of entanglement in many-body systems is a focus of intense research with the observation that entanglement holds interesting information about quantum correlations in large systems and their relation to phase transitions. In particular, it is well known that although generic, many-body states have large, extensive entropy, ground states of reasonable local Hamiltonians carry much smaller entropy, often associated with the boundary length through the so-called area law. Here we introduce a continuous family of frustration-free Hamiltonians with exactly solvable ground states and uncover a remarkable quantum phase transition whereby the entanglement scaling changes from area law into extensively large entropy. This transition shows that entanglement in many-body systems may be enhanced under special circumstances with a potential for generating ``useful'' entanglement for the purpose of quantum computing and that the full implications of locality and its restrictions on possible ground states may hold further surprises.},

  volume = {8},
  abstract = {Neural-network quantum states have recently been introduced as an Ansatz for describing the wave function of quantum many-body systems. We show that there are strong connections between neural-network quantum states in the form of restricted Boltzmann machines and some classes of tensor-network states in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that short-range restricted Boltzmann machines are entangled plaquette states, while fully connected restricted Boltzmann machines are string-bond states with a nonlocal geometry and low bond dimension. These results shed light on the underlying architecture of restricted Boltzmann machines and their efficiency at representing many-body quantum states. String-bond states also provide a generic way of enhancing the power of neural-network quantum states and a natural generalization to systems with larger local Hilbert space. We compare the advantages and drawbacks of these different classes of states and present a method to combine them together. This allows us to benefit from both the entanglement structure of tensor networks and the efficiency of neural-network quantum states into a single Ansatz capable of targeting the wave function of strongly correlated systems. While it remains a challenge to describe states with chiral topological order using traditional tensor networks, we show that, because of their nonlocal geometry, neural-network quantum states and their string-bond-state extension can describe a lattice fractional quantum Hall state exactly. In addition, we provide numerical evidence that neural-network quantum states can approximate a chiral spin liquid with better accuracy than entangled plaquette states and local string-bond states. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of neural networks to describe complex quantum wave functions and pave the way towards the use of string-bond states as a tool in more traditional machine-learning applications.},

It reminds us of the basic renormalization group (RG) concept in statistical physics. In order to explore possible relations between DNN and RG, we use the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) applied to an Ising model and construct a flow of model parameters (in particular, temperature) generated by the RBM. We show that the unsupervised RBM trained by spin configurations at various temperatures from T=0 to T=6 generates a flow along which the temperature approaches the critical value Tc=2.27. This behavior is the opposite of the typical RG flow of the Ising model. By analyzing various properties of the weight matrices of the trained RBM, we discuss why it flows towards Tc and how the RBM learns to extract features of spin configurations.},

  issn = {0217-9792},
  abstract = {Entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum theory and a main resource in quantum information science. Ground states of quantum many-body systems with local interactions typically obey an ``area law'' which means that the entanglement entropy is proportional to the boundary length. It is exceptional when the system is gapless, and the area law had been believed to be violated by at most a logarithm over two decades. Recent discovery of Motzkin and Fredkin spin chain models is striking, since these models provide significant violation of the entanglement beyond the belief, growing as a square root of the volume in spite of local interactions. In this paper, we first analytically compute the R{\'e}nyi entropy of the Motzkin and Fredkin models by careful treatment of asymptotic analysis. The R{\'e}nyi entropy is an important quantity, since the whole spectrum of an entangled subsystem is reconstructed once the R{\'e}nyi entropy is known as a function of its parameter. We find nonanalytic behavior of the R{\'e}nyi entropy with respect to the parameter, which is a novel phase transition never seen in any other spin chain studied so far. Interestingly, similar behavior is seen in the R{\'e}nyi entropy of Rokhsar\textendash{}Kivelson states in two dimensions.},

Therefore, considerable effort is dedicated to the development of new characterization tools for quantum many-body states2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Here we demonstrate matrix product state tomography2, which is theoretically proven to allow for the efficient and accurate estimation of a broad class of quantum states. We use this technique to reconstruct the dynamical state of a trapped-ion quantum simulator comprising up to 14 entangled and individually controlled spins: a size far beyond the practical limits of quantum state tomography. Our results reveal the dynamical growth of entanglement and describe its complexity as correlations spread out during a quench: a necessary condition for future demonstrations of better-than-classical performance. Matrix product state tomography should therefore find widespread use in the study of large quantum many-body systems and the benchmarking and verification of quantum simulators and computers.},

The ability of sequence models to capture temporal dependence can be characterized by the temporal scaling of correlation and mutual information. In this paper, we study the mutual information of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) including long short-term memories and self-attention networks such as Transformers. Through a combination of theoretical study of linear RNNs and empirical study of nonlinear RNNs, we find their mutual information decays exponentially in temporal distance. On the other hand, Transformers can capture long-range mutual information more efficiently, making them preferable in modeling sequences with slow power-law mutual information, such as natural languages and stock prices. We discuss the connection of these results with statistical mechanics. We also point out the non-uniformity problem in many natural language datasets. We hope this work provides a new perspective in understanding the expressive power of sequence models and shed new light on improving the architecture of them.},

As increasingly large experimental quantum devices are built in laboratories, the question of how these machine learning techniques scale with the number of qubits is becoming crucial. We empirically study the scaling of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) applied to reconstruct ground-state wavefunctions of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model from projective measurement data. We define a learning criterion via a threshold on the relative error in the energy estimator of the machine. With this criterion, we observe that the number of RBM weight parameters required for accurate representation of the ground state in the worst case - near criticality - scales quadratically with the number of qubits. By pruning small parameters of the trained model, we find that the number of weights can be significantly reduced while still retaining an accurate reconstruction. This provides evidence that over-parametrization of the RBM is required to facilitate the learning process.},

Beginning with an overview of quantum phase transitions, we introduce a number of model Hamiltonians. We provide exact solutions in one spatial dimension connecting them to conformal field theoretical studies. We also discuss Kitaev models and some other exactly solvable spin systems. Studies of quantum phase transitions in the presence of quenched randomness and with frustrating interactions are presented in detail. We discuss novel phenomena like Griffiths-McCoy singularities. We then turn to more recent topics like information theoretic measures of the quantum phase transitions in these models such as concurrence, entanglement entropy, quantum discord and quantum fidelity. We then focus on non-equilibrium dynamics of a variety of transverse field systems across quantum critical points and lines. After mentioning rapid quenching studies, we dwell on slow dynamics and discuss the Kibble-Zurek scaling for the defect density following a quench across critical points and its modifications for quenching across critical lines, gapless regions and multicritical points. Topics like the role of different quenching schemes, local quenching, quenching of models with random interactions and quenching of a spin chain coupled to a heat bath are touched upon. The connection between non-equilibrium dynamics and quantum information theoretic measures is presented at some length. We indicate the connection between Kibble-Zurek scaling and adiabatic evolution of a state as well as the application of adiabatic dynamics as a tool of a quantum optimization technique known as quantum annealing. The final section is dedicated to a detailed discussion on recent experimental studies of transverse Ising-like systems.},

Farhi et al., arXiv:1411.4028; arXiv:1412.6062; arXiv:1602.07674). A level-p QAOA circuit consists of p steps; in each step a classical Hamiltonian, derived from the cost function, is applied followed by a mixing Hamiltonian. The 2p times for which these two Hamiltonians are applied are the parameters of the algorithm, which are to be optimized classically for the best performance. As p increases, parameter optimization becomes inefficient due to the curse of dimensionality. The success of the QAOA approach will depend, in part, on finding effective parameter-setting strategies. Here we analytically and numerically study parameter setting for the QAOA applied to MaxCut. For the level-1 QAOA, we derive an analytical expression for a general graph. In principle, expressions for higher p could be derived, but the number of terms quickly becomes prohibitive. For a special case of MaxCut, the ``ring of disagrees,'' or the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic ring, we provide an analysis for an arbitrarily high level. Using a fermionic representation, the evolution of the system under the QAOA translates into quantum control of an ensemble of independent spins. This treatment enables us to obtain analytical expressions for the performance of the QAOA for any p. It also greatly simplifies the numerical search for the optimal values of the parameters. By exploring symmetries, we identify a lower-dimensional submanifold of interest; the search effort can be accordingly reduced. This analysis also explains an observed symmetry in the optimal parameter values. Further, we numerically investigate the parameter landscape and show that it is a simple one in the sense of having no local optima.},

To achieve this, we define a class of optimization problems with respect to their spectral properties which are exactly solvable with QAOA. In this class, we identify instances for which QA and SA have an exponentially small probability to find the solution. Consequently, our results define a first demarcation line between QAOA, Simulated Annealing and Quantum Annealing, and highlight the fundamental differences between an interference-based search heuristic such as QAOA and heuristics that are based on thermal and quantum fluctuations like SA and QA respectively.},

  abstract = {Quantum phase transitions occur at zero temperature and involve the appearance of long-range correlations. These correlations are not due to thermal fluctuations but to the intricate structure of a strongly entangled ground state of the system. We present a microscopic computation of the scaling properties of the ground-state entanglement in several 1D spin chain models both near and at the quantum critical regimes. We quantify entanglement by using the entropy of the ground state when the system is traced down to \$L\$ spins. This entropy is seen to scale logarithmically with \$L\$, with a coefficient that corresponds to the central charge associated to the conformal theory that describes the universal properties of the quantum phase transition. Thus we show that entanglement, a key concept of quantum information science, obeys universal scaling laws as dictated by the representations of the conformal group and its classification motivated by string theory. This connection unveils a monotonicity law for ground-state entanglement along the renormalization group flow. We also identify a majorization rule possibly associated to conformal invariance and apply the present results to interpret the breakdown of density matrix renormalization group techniques near a critical point.},

For a block corresponding to a half of a finite chain, the position of the maximum of the entropy as a function of the control parameter (e.g. the transverse field) can define the effective critical point in the finite sample.

In this work we study the entanglement entropy (EE) of the SYKq models for a bipartition of N real or complex fermions into subsystems containing 2m real/m complex fermions and N-2m/N-m fermions in the remainder. For the free model SYK2, we obtain an analytic expression for the EE, derived from the {$\beta$}-Jacobi random matrix ensemble. Furthermore, we use the replica trick and path-integral formalism to show that the EE is maximal when one subsystem is small, i.e., m{$\ll$}N, for arbitrary q. We also demonstrate that the EE for the SYK4 model is noticeably smaller than the Page value when the two subsystems are comparable in size, i.e., m/N is O(1). Finally, we explore the EE for a model with both SYK2 and SYK4 interactions and find a crossover from SYK2 (low-temperature) to SYK4 (high-temperature) behavior as we vary energy.},

  abstract = {The next few years will be exciting as prototype universal quantum processors emerge, enabling implementation of a wider variety of algorithms. Of particular interest are quantum heuristics, which require experimentation on quantum hardware for their evaluation, and which have the potential to significantly expand the breadth of quantum computing applications. A leading candidate is Farhi et al.'s Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which alternates between applying a cost-function-based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian. Here, we extend this framework to allow alternation between more general families of operators. The essence of this extension, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, is the consideration of general parametrized families of unitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time-evolution under a fixed local Hamiltonian for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz supports the representation of a larger, and potentially more useful, set of states than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a broad array of application areas. For cases that call for mixing only within a desired subspace, refocusing on unitaries rather than Hamiltonians enables more efficiently implementable mixers than was possible in the original framework. Such mixers are particularly useful for optimization problems with hard constraints that must always be satisfied, defining a feasible subspace, and soft constraints whose violation we wish to minimize. More efficient implementation enables earlier experimental exploration of an alternating operator approach to a wide variety of approximate optimization, exact optimization, and sampling problems. Here, we introduce the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, lay out design criteria for mixing operators, detail mappings for eight problems, and provide brief descriptions of mappings for diverse problems.},

  abstract = {The projective quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC) algorithms are among the most powerful computational techniques to simulate the ground state properties of quantum many-body systems. However, they are efficient only if a sufficiently accurate trial wave function is used to guide the simulation. In the standard approach, this guiding wave function is obtained in a separate simulation that performs a variational minimization. Here we show how to perform PQMC simulations guided by an adaptive wave function based on a restricted Boltzmann machine. This adaptive wave function is optimized along the PQMC simulation via unsupervised machine learning, avoiding the need of a separate variational optimization. As a byproduct, this technique provides an accurate ansatz for the ground state wave function, which is obtained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to the PQMC samples, rather than by minimizing the energy expectation value as in standard variational optimizations. The high accuracy of this self-learning PQMC technique is demonstrated for a paradigmatic sign-problem-free model, namely, the ferromagnetic quantum Ising chain, showing very precise agreement with the predictions of the Jordan-Wigner theory and of loop quantum Monte Carlo simulations performed in the low-temperature limit.},

By approximating the dynamics at finite time steps, the algorithm can be expressed as alternating evolution under two non-commuting Hamiltonians. We show that each step of the algorithm updates the wavefunction in the direction of its local gradient, with an additional momentum-dependent displacement. For initial states in a superposition over many points, this method can therefore be interpreted as a coherent version of gradient descent, i.e., 'gradient descent in superposition.' This approach can be used for both constrained and unconstrained optimization. In terms of computational complexity, we show how variants of the algorithm can recover continuous-variable Grover search, and how a single iteration can replicate continuous-variable instantaneous quantum polynomial circuits. We also discuss how the algorithm can be adapted to solve discrete optimization problems. Finally, we test the algorithm through numerical simulation in optimizing the Styblinski-Tang function.},

the DQMC and VMC techniques, respectively. We demonstrate that our VQMC allows
us to access lower temperatures in comparison with the conventional DQMC before

  abstract = {We introduce a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

  abstract = {An efficient way to compute Hamiltonian ground-states on a quantum computer stands to impact many problems in the physical and computer sciences, ranging from quantum simulation to machine learning. Unfortunately, existing techniques, such as phase estimation and variational algorithms, display formal and practical disadvantages, such as requirements for deep circuits and high-dimensional optimization. We describe the quantum imaginary time evolution and quantum Lanczos algorithms, analogs of classical algorithms for ground (and excited) states, but with exponentially reduced space and time requirements per iteration, and without deep circuits, ancillae, or high-dimensional non-linear optimization. We further discuss quantum imaginary time evolution as a natural subroutine to generate Gibbs averages through an analog of minimally entangled typical thermal states. We implement these algorithms with exact classical emulation as well as in prototype circuits on the Rigetti quantum virtual machine and Aspen-1 quantum processing unit, demonstrating the power of quantum elevations of classical algorithms.},

  abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, QAOA, uses a shallow depth quantum circuit to produce a parameter dependent state. For a given combinatorial optimization problem instance, the quantum expectation of the associated cost function is the parameter dependent objective function of the QAOA. We demonstrate that if the parameters are fixed and the instance comes from a reasonable distribution then the objective function value is concentrated in the sense that typical instances have (nearly) the same value of the objective function. This applies not just for optimal parameters as the whole landscape is instance independent. We can prove this is true for low depth quantum circuits for instances of MaxCut on large 3-regular graphs. Our results generalize beyond this example. We support the arguments with numerical examples that show remarkable concentration. For higher depth circuits the numerics also show concentration and we argue for this using the Law of Large Numbers. We also observe by simulation that if we find parameters which result in good performance at say 10 bits these same parameters result in good performance at say 24 bits. These findings suggest ways to run the QAOA that reduce or eliminate the use of the outer loop optimization and may allow us to find good solutions with fewer calls to the quantum computer.},

  abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm designed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. Despite its promise for near-term quantum applications, not much is currently understood about QAOA's performance beyond its lowest-depth variant. An essential but missing ingredient for understanding and deploying QAOA is a constructive approach to carry out the outer-loop classical optimization. We provide an in-depth study of the performance of QAOA on MaxCut problems by developing an efficient parameter-optimization procedure and revealing its ability to exploit non-adiabatic operations. Building on observed patterns in optimal parameters, we propose heuristic optimization strategies that find quasi-optimal parameters in \$O(\textbackslash{}textrm\{poly\}(p))\$ time without the \$2\^\{O(p)\}\$ resources required by brute-force approaches. We then benchmark QAOA and compare it with quantum annealing, especially on difficult instances where adiabatic quantum annealing fails due to small spectral gaps. The comparison reveals that QAOA can learn via optimization to utilize non-adiabatic mechanisms to circumvent the challenges associated with vanishing spectral gaps. Finally, we provide a realistic resource analysis on the experimental implementation of QAOA. When quantum fluctuations in measurements are accounted for, we illustrate that optimization will be important only for problem sizes beyond numerical simulations, but accessible on near-term devices. We propose a feasible implementation of large MaxCut problems with a few hundred vertices in a system of 2D neutral atoms, reaching the regime to challenge the best classical algorithms.},

Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply "autodiff", is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names "dynamic computational graphs" and "differentiable programming". We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms "autodiff", "automatic differentiation", and "symbolic differentiation" as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

  abstract = {Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) are a promising variational learning paradigm with applications to near-term quantum processors, however they still face some significant challenges. One such challenge is finding good parameter initialization heuristics that ensure rapid and consistent convergence to local minima of the parameterized quantum circuit landscape. In this work, we train classical neural networks to assist in the quantum learning process, also know as meta-learning, to rapidly find approximate optima in the parameter landscape for several classes of quantum variational algorithms. Specifically, we train classical recurrent neural networks to find approximately optimal parameters within a small number of queries of the cost function for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for MaxCut, QAOA for Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising model, and for a Variational Quantum Eigensolver for the Hubbard model. By initializing other optimizers at parameter values suggested by the classical neural network, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the total number of optimization iterations required to reach a given accuracy. We further demonstrate that the optimization strategies learned by the neural network generalize well across a range of problem instance sizes. This opens up the possibility of training on small, classically simulatable problem instances, in order to initialize larger, classically intractably simulatable problem instances on quantum devices, thereby significantly reducing the number of required quantum-classical optimization iterations.},

Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},

We show experimentally that all common RNN architectures achieve nearly the same per-task and per-unit capacity bounds with careful training, for a variety of tasks and stacking depths. They can store an amount of task information which is linear in the number of parameters, and is approximately 5 bits per parameter. They can additionally store approximately one real number from their input history per hidden unit. We further find that for several tasks it is the per-task parameter capacity bound that determines performance. These results suggest that many previous results comparing RNN architectures are driven primarily by differences in training effectiveness, rather than differences in capacity. Supporting this observation, we compare training difficulty for several architectures, and show that vanilla RNNs are far more difficult to train, yet have slightly higher capacity. Finally, we propose two novel RNN architectures, one of which is easier to train than the LSTM or GRU for deeply stacked architectures.},

This suggests a two-stage learning procedure that first learns a large net and then prunes away connections or hidden units. But standard training does not necessarily encourage nets to be amenable to pruning. We introduce targeted dropout, a method for training a neural network so that it is robust to subsequent pruning. Before computing the gradients for each weight update, targeted dropout stochastically selects a set of units or weights to be dropped using a simple self-reinforcing sparsity criterion and then computes the gradients for the remaining weights. The resulting network is robust to post hoc pruning of weights or units that frequently occur in the dropped sets. The method improves upon more complicated sparsifying regularisers while being simple to implement and easy to tune.},

In this paper, we introduce a numerically stable and differentiable approach to leveraging eigenvectors in deep networks. It can handle large matrices without requiring to split them. We demonstrate the better robustness of our approach over standard ED and PI for ZCA whitening, an alternative to batch normalization, and for PCA denoising, which we introduce as a new normalization strategy for deep networks, aiming to further denoise the network's features.},

  title = {Stabilizing the {{Lottery Ticket Hypothesis}}},
  abstract = {Pruning is a well-established technique for removing unnecessary structure from neural networks after training to improve the performance of inference. Several recent results have explored the possibility of pruning at initialization time to provide similar benefits during training. In particular, the "lottery ticket hypothesis" conjectures that typical neural networks contain small subnetworks that can train to similar accuracy in a commensurate number of steps. The evidence for this claim is that a procedure based on iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) reliably finds such subnetworks retroactively on small vision tasks. However, IMP fails on deeper networks, and proposed methods to prune before training or train pruned networks encounter similar scaling limitations. In this paper, we argue that these efforts have struggled on deeper networks because they have focused on pruning precisely at initialization. We modify IMP to search for subnetworks that could have been obtained by pruning early in training (0.1\% to 7\% through) rather than at iteration 0. With this change, it finds small subnetworks of deeper networks (e.g., 80\% sparsity on Resnet-50) that can complete the training process to match the accuracy of the original network on more challenging tasks (e.g., ImageNet). In situations where IMP fails at iteration 0, the accuracy benefits of delaying pruning accrue rapidly over the earliest iterations of training. To explain these behaviors, we study subnetwork "stability," finding that - as accuracy improves in this fashion - IMP subnetworks train to parameters closer to those of the full network and do so with improved consistency in the face of gradient noise. These results offer new insights into the opportunity to prune large-scale networks early in training and the behaviors underlying the lottery ticket hypothesis.},

Unfortunately, finding these "winning ticket" initializations is computationally expensive. One potential solution is to reuse the same winning tickets across a variety of datasets and optimizers. However, the generality of winning ticket initializations remains unclear. Here, we attempt to answer this question by generating winning tickets for one training configuration (optimizer and dataset) and evaluating their performance on another configuration. Perhaps surprisingly, we found that, within the natural images domain, winning ticket initializations generalized across a variety of datasets, including Fashion MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and Places365, often achieving performance close to that of winning tickets generated on the same dataset. Moreover, winning tickets generated using larger datasets consistently transferred better than those generated using smaller datasets. We also found that winning ticket initializations generalize across optimizers with high performance. These results suggest that winning ticket initializations contain inductive biases generic to neural networks more broadly which improve training across many settings and provide hope for the development of better initialization methods.},

We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the "lottery ticket hypothesis:" dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks ("winning tickets") that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective. We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20\% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.},

possible modifications of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms aimed at
alleviating the sign problem which appears in many interesting physical
situations, e.g. in the Hubbard model away from half filling. In this approach
one utilizes the fact that the integral over real variables with an integrand
containing a complex fluctuating phase is equivalent to the sum of integrals
over special manifolds in complex space ("Lefschetz thimbles"), each of them
having a fixed complex phase factor. Thus, the sign problem can be reduced if
the resulting sum contains terms with only a few different phases. We explore
the complexity of the sign problem for the few-site Hubbard model on square
lattice combining a semi-analytical study of saddle points and thimbles in
small lattices with several steps in Euclidean time with results of test QMC
calculations. We check different variants of conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich
transformation based on Gaussian integrals. On the basis of our analysis we
reveal a regime with minimal number of relevant thimbles in the vicinity of
half filling. In this regime we found only two relevant thimbles for the
few-site lattices studied in the paper. There is also indirect evidence of the
existence of this regime in more realistic systems with large number of
Euclidean time slices. In addition, we derive a new non-Gaussian representation
of the interaction term, where the number of relevant Lefschetz is also reduced

  abstract = {We introduce the feedforward neural network to attack the sign problem via
the path optimization method. The variables of integration is complexified and
the integration path is optimized in the complexified space by minimizing the
cost function which reflects the seriousness of the sign problem. For the
preparation and optimization of the integral path in multi-dimensional systems,
we utilize the feedforward neural network. We examine the validity and
usefulness of the method in the two-dimensional complex \${$\lambda\phi\sphat$}4\$ theory
at finite chemical potential as an example of the quantum field theory having
the sign problem. We show that the average phase factor is significantly
enhanced after the optimization and then we can safely perform the hybrid
Monte-Carlo method.},

  abstract = {Flow based models such as Real NVP are an extremely powerful approach to density estimation. However, existing flow based models are restricted to transforming continuous densities over a continuous input space into similarly continuous distributions over continuous latent variables. This makes them poorly suited for modeling and representing discrete structures in data distributions, for example class membership or discrete symmetries. To address this difficulty, we present a normalizing flow architecture which relies on domain partitioning using locally invertible functions, and possesses both real and discrete valued latent variables. This Real and Discrete (RAD) approach retains the desirable normalizing flow properties of exact sampling, exact inference, and analytically computable probabilities, while at the same time allowing simultaneous modeling of both continuous and discrete structure in a data distribution.},

Motivated by long range interactions (LRI) intrinsic to many experimental platforms (trapped ions, Rydberg atom arrays, etc.), we investigate the performance of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with LRIs for the preparation of non-trivial quantum states. We show that this approach leads to extremely efficient state preparation: for example, Greene-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states can be prepared with O(1) circuit depth, and a quantum critical point of the long range transverse field Ising model (TFIM) can be prepared with {$>$} 99\% fidelity on a 100 qubit system with only one iteration of QAOA. Furthermore, we show that QAOA with LRIs is a promising route for exploring generic points in the phase diagram of the long-range TFIM. Our approach thus provides concrete, ultrafast protocols for quantum simulators equipped with long range interactions.},

We prove that under general conditions most of the quantum circuits at any constant level of noise per gate can be efficiently simulated classically with the cost increasing only polynomially with the size of the circuits. The result holds even if we have perfect noiseless quantum gates for some subsets of operations, such as all the gates in the Clifford group.

We show that given proper initialization, learning expounds parallel independent modes and that certain regions of parameter space might lead to failed training. We also demonstrate that input norm and features' frequency in the dataset lead to distinct convergence speeds which might shed some light on the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks. We provide a comparison between the dynamics of learning with cross-entropy and hinge losses, which could prove useful to understand recent progress in the training of generative adversarial networks.

By training a goal-conditioned policy with an information bottleneck, we can identify decision states by examining where the model actually leverages the goal state. We find that this simple mechanism effectively identifies decision states, even in partially observed settings. In effect, the model learns the sensory cues that correlate with potential subgoals. In new environments, this model can then identify novel subgoals for further exploration, guiding the agent through a sequence of potential decision states and through new regions of the state space.},

This correspondence enables exact Bayesian inference for infinite width neural networks on regression tasks by means of evaluating the corresponding GP. Recently, kernel functions which mimic multi-layer random neural networks have been developed, but only outside of a Bayesian framework. As such, previous work has not identified that these kernels can be used as covariance functions for GPs and allow fully Bayesian prediction with a deep neural network. In this work, we derive the exact equivalence between infinitely wide deep networks and GPs. We further develop a computationally efficient pipeline to compute the covariance function for these GPs. We then use the resulting GPs to perform Bayesian inference for wide deep neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We observe that trained neural network accuracy approaches that of the corresponding GP with increasing layer width, and that the GP uncertainty is strongly correlated with trained network prediction error. We further find that test performance increases as finite-width trained networks are made wider and more similar to a GP, and thus that GP predictions typically outperform those of finite-width networks. Finally we connect the performance of these GPs to the recent theory of signal propagation in random neural networks.},

Intuitively, this property is in line with the observation that over-parameterized networks find simple patterns that generalize across data samples. We also investigate how the shape of the data manifold affects expressivity by showing evidence that learning high frequencies gets \textbackslash{}emph\{easier\} with increasing manifold complexity, and present a theoretical understanding of this behavior.

  title = {Quaternion {{Convolutional Neural Networks}} for {{End}}-to-{{End Automatic Speech Recognition}}},
  abstract = {Recently, the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model coupled with recurrent (RNN) or convolutional neural networks (CNN), made it easier to train speech recognition systems in an end-to-end fashion. However in real-valued models, time frame components such as mel-filter-bank energies and the cepstral coefficients obtained from them, together with their first and second order derivatives, are processed as individual elements, while a natural alternative is to process such components as composed entities. We propose to group such elements in the form of quaternions and to process these quaternions using the established quaternion algebra. Quaternion numbers and quaternion neural networks have shown their efficiency to process multidimensional inputs as entities, to encode internal dependencies, and to solve many tasks with less learning parameters than real-valued models. This paper proposes to integrate multiple feature views in quaternion-valued convolutional neural network (QCNN), to be used for sequence-to-sequence mapping with the CTC model. Promising results are reported using simple QCNNs in phoneme recognition experiments with the TIMIT corpus. More precisely, QCNNs obtain a lower phoneme error rate (PER) with less learning parameters than a competing model based on real-valued CNNs.},

  abstract = {It has been noted in existing literature that over-parameterization in ReLU networks generally leads to better performance. While there could be several reasons for this, we investigate desirable network properties at initialization which may be enjoyed by ReLU networks. Without making any assumption, we derive a lower bound on the layer width of deep ReLU networks whose weights are initialized from a certain distribution, such that with high probability, i) the norm of hidden activation of all layers are roughly equal to the norm of the input, and, ii) the norm of parameter gradient for all the layers are roughly the same. In this way, sufficiently wide deep ReLU nets with appropriate initialization can inherently preserve the forward flow of information and also avoid the gradient exploding/vanishing problem. We further show that these results hold for an infinite number of data samples, in which case the finite lower bound depends on the input dimensionality and the depth of the network. In the case of deep ReLU networks with weight vectors normalized by their norm, we derive an initialization required to tap the aforementioned benefits from over-parameterization without which network fails to learn for large depth.},

  abstract = {Training energy-based probabilistic models is confronted with apparently intractable sums, whose Monte Carlo estimation requires sampling from the estimated probability distribution in the inner loop of training. This can be approximately achieved by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, but may still face a formidable obstacle that is the difficulty of mixing between modes with sharp concentrations of probability. Whereas an MCMC process is usually derived from a given energy function based on mathematical considerations and requires an arbitrarily long time to obtain good and varied samples, we propose to train a deep directed generative model (not a Markov chain) so that its sampling distribution approximately matches the energy function that is being trained. Inspired by generative adversarial networks, the proposed framework involves training of two models that represent dual views of the estimated probability distribution: the energy function (mapping an input configuration to a scalar energy value) and the generator (mapping a noise vector to a generated configuration), both represented by deep neural networks.},

Here, we consider learning both an energy function and an efficient approximate sampling mechanism. Whereas the discriminator in generative adversarial networks (GANs) learns to separate data and generator samples, introducing an entropy maximization regularizer on the generator can turn the interpretation of the critic into an energy function, which separates the training distribution from everything else, and thus can be used for tasks like anomaly or novelty detection. Then, we show how Markov Chain Monte Carlo can be done in the generator latent space whose samples can be mapped to data space, producing better samples. These samples are used for the negative phase gradient required to estimate the log-likelihood gradient of the data space energy function. To maximize entropy at the output of the generator, we take advantage of recently introduced neural estimators of mutual information. We find that in addition to producing a useful scoring function for anomaly detection, the resulting approach produces sharp samples while covering the modes well, leading to high Inception and Frechet scores.},

Here, we concisely review recent progresses made in developing new sign-problem-free QMC algorithms, including those employing Majorana representation and those utilizing hot-spot physics.

The answer to the question --- whether there is an fundamental obstruction to such a sign-free representation in generic quantum systems --- remains unclear. Here, focussing on systems with bosonic degrees of freedom, we show that quantized gravitational responses appear as obstructions to local sign-free QMC. In condensed matter physics settings these responses, such as thermal Hall conductance, are associated with fractional quantum Hall effects. We show that similar arguments hold also in the case of spontaneously broken time-reversal (TR) symmetry such as in the chiral phase of a perturbed quantum Kagome antiferromagnet. The connection between quantized gravitational responses and the sign problem is also clearly manifested in certain vertex models, where TR symmetry is preserved.},

Baqprop encodes error information in relative phases of a quantum wavefunction defined over the space of network parameters; it can be thought of as the unification of the phase kickback principle of quantum computation and of the backpropagation algorithm from classical deep learning. We propose two core heuristics which leverage Baqprop for quantum-enhanced optimization of network parameters: Quantum Dynamical Descent (QDD) and Momentum Measurement Gradient Descent (MoMGrad). QDD uses simulated quantum coherent dynamics for parameter optimization, allowing for quantum tunneling through the hypothesis space landscape. MoMGrad leverages Baqprop to estimate gradients and thereby perform gradient descent on the parameter landscape; it can be thought of as the quantum-classical analogue of QDD. In addition to these core optimization strategies, we propose various methods for parallelization, regularization, and meta-learning as augmentations to MoMGrad and QDD. We introduce several quantum-coherent adaptations of canonical classical feedforward neural networks, and study how Baqprop can be used to optimize such networks. We develop multiple applications of parametric circuit learning for quantum data, and show how to perform Baqprop in each case. One such application allows for the training of hybrid quantum-classical neural-circuit networks, via the seamless integration of Baqprop with classical backpropagation. Finally, for a representative subset of these proposed applications, we demonstrate the training of these networks via numerical simulations of implementations of QDD and MoMGrad.},

Neural network representation of quantum many-body states shows great potential in solving some traditionally difficult quantum problems involving large number of freedoms.

Some physical properties of the neural network states, including entanglement features, representational power, and the relation with tensor network states, are discussed.

A neuron receives multiple signals, internally combines them, and applies a non-linear function to the resulting weighted sum. Several attempts to generalize neurons to the quantum regime have been proposed, but all proposals collided with the difficulty of implementing non-linear activation functions, which is essential for classical neurons, due to the linear nature of quantum mechanics. Here we propose a solution to this roadblock in the form of a small quantum circuit that naturally simulates neurons with threshold activation. Our quantum circuit defines a building block, the "quantum neuron", that can reproduce a variety of classical neural network constructions while maintaining the ability to process superpositions of inputs and preserve quantum coherence and entanglement. In the construction of feedforward networks of quantum neurons, we provide numerical evidence that the network not only can learn a function when trained with superposition of inputs and the corresponding output, but that this training suffices to learn the function on all individual inputs separately. When arranged to mimic Hopfield networks, quantum neural networks exhibit properties of associative memory. Patterns are encoded using the simple Hebbian rule for the weights and we demonstrate attractor dynamics from corrupted inputs. Finally, the fact that our quantum model closely captures (traditional) neural network dynamics implies that the vast body of literature and results on neural networks becomes directly relevant in the context of quantum machine learning.},

The quantum circuit consists of a sequence of parameter dependent unitary transformations which acts on an input quantum state. For binary classification a single Pauli operator is measured on a designated readout qubit. The measured output is the quantum neural network's predictor of the binary label of the input state. First we look at classifying classical data sets which consist of n-bit strings with binary labels. The input quantum state is an n-bit computational basis state corresponding to a sample string. We show how to design a circuit made from two qubit unitaries that can correctly represent the label of any Boolean function of n bits. For certain label functions the circuit is exponentially long. We introduce parameter dependent unitaries that can be adapted by supervised learning of labeled data. We study an example of real world data consisting of downsampled images of handwritten digits each of which has been labeled as one of two distinct digits. We show through classical simulation that parameters can be found that allow the QNN to learn to correctly distinguish the two data sets. We then discuss presenting the data as quantum superpositions of computational basis states corresponding to different label values. Here we show through simulation that learning is possible. We consider using our QNN to learn the label of a general quantum state. By example we show that this can be done. Our work is exploratory and relies on the classical simulation of small quantum systems. The QNN proposed here was designed with near-term quantum processors in mind.

Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

  abstract = {Physically motivated classical heuristic optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing (SA) treat the objective function as an energy landscape, and allow walkers to escape local minima. It has been argued that quantum properties such as tunneling may give quantum algorithms advantage in finding ground states of vast, rugged cost landscapes. Indeed, the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QAO) and the recent Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) have shown promising results on various problem instances that are considered classically hard. Here, we argue that the type of control strategy used by the optimization algorithm may be crucial to its success. Along with SA, QAO and QAOA, we define a new, bang-bang version of simulated annealing, BBSA, and study the performance of these algorithms on two well-studied problem instances from the literature. Both classically and quantumly, the successful control strategy is found to be bang-bang, exponentially outperforming the quasistatic analogues on the same instances. Lastly, we construct O(1)-depth QAOA protocols for a class of symmetric cost functions, and provide an accompanying physical picture.},

  title = {Photo-{{Realistic Single Image Super}}-{{Resolution Using}} a {{Generative Adversarial Network}}},
  abstract = {Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.},

We use a form of domain decomposition for training and inference, where each sub-domain (tile) is comprised of a non-overlapping focus region surrounded by an overlapping context region. The size of these regions is motivated by the physical interaction length scales of the problem. We demonstrate the application of EDNNs to three physical systems: the Ising model and two hexagonal/graphene-like datasets. In the latter, an EDNN was able to make total energy predictions of a 60 atoms system, to DFT accuracy, in 57 milliseconds. Additionally EDNNs are well suited for massively parallel evaluation, as no communication is necessary during neural network evaluation. We demonstrate that EDNNs can be used to make an energy prediction of a two-dimensional 35.2 million atom system, over 1.0 square-micrometer of material, at an accuracy comparable to DFT, in under 25 minutes. Such a system exists on a length scale visible with optical microscopy and larger than some living organisms.},

The network computes variational free energy, estimates physical quantities such as entropy, magnetizations and correlations, and generates uncorrelated samples all at once. Training of the network employs the policy gradient approach in reinforcement learning, which unbiasedly estimates the gradient of variational parameters. We apply our approach to several classical systems, including 2-d Ising models, Hopfield model, Sherrington--Kirkpatrick spin glasses, and the inverse Ising model, for demonstrating its advantages over existing variational mean-field methods.

Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.},

We devise an adversarial quantum-classical hybrid training scheme via coupling a quantum circuit generator and a classical neural network discriminator together. After training, the quantum circuit generative model can infer missing data with quadratic speed up via amplitude amplification. We numerically simulate the learning and inference of generative adversarial quantum circuit using the prototypical Bars-and-Stripes dataset.

However, heuristic classical approaches are often very efficient in approximately simulating special circuit structures, for example with limited entanglement, or based on one-dimensional geometries. Here we introduce a classical approach to the simulation of general quantum circuits based on neural-network quantum states (NQS) representations. Considering a set of universal quantum gates, we derive rules for exactly applying single-qubit and two-qubit Z rotations to NQS, whereas we provide a learning scheme to approximate the action of Hadamard gates. Results are shown for the Hadamard and Fourier transform of entangled initial states for systems sizes and total circuit depths exceeding what can be currently simulated with state-of-the-art brute-force techniques. The overall accuracy obtained by the neural-network states based on Restricted Boltzmann machines is satisfactory, and offers a classical route to simulating highly-entangled circuits. In the test cases considered, we find that our classical simulations are comparable to quantum simulations affected by an incoherent noise level in the hardware of about \$10\^\{-3\}\$ per gate.},

We discuss in particular the limit of high temperature (HT) or the situation of finite temperature phase transitions. There the concept of dimensional reduction plays an essential role. Dimensional reduction in some sense reflects the known property that quantum effects are not important at high temperature. We illustrate these ideas with several standard examples, phi\^4 field theory, the non-linear sigma model and the Gross-Neveu model, gauge theories. We construct the corresponding effective reduced theories at one-loop order, using the technique of mode expansion of fields in the imaginary time variable. In models where the field is a vector with N components, the large N expansion provides another specially convenient tool to study dimensional reduction.},

  abstract = {Gate model quantum computers with too many qubits to be simulated by available classical computers are about to arrive. We present a strategy for programming these devices without error correction or compilation. This means that the number of logical qubits is the same as the number of qubits on the device. The hardware determines which pairs of qubits can be addressed by unitary operators. The goal is to build quantum states that solve computational problems such as maximizing a combinatorial objective function or minimizing a Hamiltonian. These problems may not fit naturally on the physical layout of the qubits. Our algorithms use a sequence of parameterized unitaries that sit on the qubit layout to produce quantum states depending on those parameters. Measurements of the objective function (or Hamiltonian) guide the choice of new parameters with the goal of moving the objective function up (or lowering the energy). As an example we consider finding approximate solutions to MaxCut on 3-regular graphs whereas the hardware is physical qubits laid out on a rectangular grid. We prove that the lowest depth version of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm will achieve an approximation ratio of at least 0.5293 on all large enough instances which beats random guessing (0.5). We open up the algorithm to have different parameters for each single qubit \$X\$ rotation and for each \$ZZ\$ interaction associated with the nearest neighbor interactions on the grid. Small numerical experiments indicate that an enveloping classical algorithm can be used to find the parameters which sit on the grid to optimize an objective function with a different connectivity. We discuss strategies for finding good parameters but offer no evidence yet that the proposed approach can beat the best classical algorithms. Ultimately the strength of this approach will be determined by running on actual hardware.},

The model performs hierarchical change-of-variables transformations from the physical space to a latent space with reduced mutual information. Conversely, the neural net directly maps independent Gaussian noises to physical configurations following the inverse RG flow. The model has an exact and tractable likelihood, which allows unbiased training and direct access to the renormalized energy function of the latent variables. To train the model, we employ probability density distillation for the bare energy function of the physical problem, in which the training loss provides a variational upper bound of the physical free energy. We demonstrate practical usage of the approach by identifying mutually independent collective variables of the Ising model and performing accelerated hybrid Monte Carlo sampling in the latent space. Lastly, we comment on the connection of the present approach to the wavelet formulation of RG and the modern pursuit of information preserving RG.},

  abstract = {It was recently proposed to leverage the representational power of artificial neural networks, in particular Restricted Boltzmann Machines, in order to model complex quantum states of many-body systems [G. Carleo and M. Troyer, Science355(6325) (2017) 602.]. States represented in this way, called Neural Network States (NNSs), were shown to display interesting properties like the ability to efficiently capture long-range quantum correlations. However, identifying an optimal neural network representation of a given state might be challenging, and so far this problem has been addressed with st{\"o}chastic optimization techniques. In this work, we explore a different direction. We study how the action of elementary quantum operations modifies NNSs. We parametrize a family of many body quantum operations that can be directly applied to states represented by Unrestricted Boltzmann Machines, by just adding hidden nodes and updating the network parameters. We show that this parametrization contains a set of universal quantum gates, from which it follows that the state prepared by any quantum circuit can be expressed as a Neural Network State with a number of hidden nodes that grows linearly with the number of elementary operations in the circuit. This is a powerful representation theorem (which was recently obtained with different methods) but that is not directly useful, since there is no general and efficient way to extract information from this unrestricted description of quantum states. To circumvent this problem, we propose a step-wise procedure based on the projection of Unrestricted quantum states to Restricted quantum states. In turn, two approximate methods to perform this projection are discussed. In this way, we show that it is in principle possible to approximately optimize or evolve Neural Network States without relying on stochastic methods such as Variational Monte Carlo, which are computationally expensive.},

As a preliminary step, we investigate the accuracy of such unrestricted neural network states as variational Ans{\"a}tze for the ground state of the ferromagnetic quantum Ising chain. We find that by optimizing just three variational parameters, independently on the system size, accurate ground-state energies are obtained, comparable to those previously obtained using restricted Boltzmann machines with few variational parameters per spin. Chiefly, we show that if one uses optimized unrestricted neural network states as guiding functions for importance sampling, the efficiency of the PQMC algorithms is greatly enhanced, drastically reducing the most relevant systematic bias, namely, the one due to the finite random-walker population. The scaling of the computational cost with the system size changes from the exponential scaling characteristic of PQMC simulations performed without importance sampling, to a polynomial scaling, apparently even at the ferromagnetic quantum critical point. The important role of the protocol chosen to sample hidden-spin configurations, in particular at the critical point, is analyzed. We discuss the implications of these findings for what concerns the problem of simulating adiabatic quantum optimization using stochastic algorithms on classical computers.},

There has been significant progress in developing algorithms to calculate the ground state energy of molecules on near-term quantum computers. However, calculating excited state energies has attracted comparatively less attention, and it is currently unclear what the optimal method is. We introduce a low depth, variational quantum algorithm to sequentially calculate the excited states of general Hamiltonians. Incorporating a recently proposed technique [O. Higgott, D. Wang, and S. Brierley, arXiv:1805.08138], we employ the low depth swap test to energetically penalize the ground state, and transform excited states into ground states of modified Hamiltonians. We use variational imaginary time evolution as a subroutine, which deterministically propagates toward the target eigenstate. We discuss how symmetry measurements can mitigate errors in the swap test step. We numerically test our algorithm on Hamiltonians which encode 3SAT optimization problems of up to 18 qubits, and the electronic structure of the lithium hydride molecule. As our algorithm uses only low depth circuits and variational algorithms, it is suitable for use on near-term quantum hardware.},

The leading nonadiabatic response of the system driven to a quantum-critical point is universal and characterized by the same exponents in real and imaginary time. For a linear quench protocol, the fidelity susceptibility and the geometric tensor naturally emerge in the response functions. Beyond linear response, we extend the finite-size scaling theory of quantum phase transitions to nonequilibrium setups. This allows, e.g., for studies of quantum phase transitions in systems of fixed finite size by monitoring expectation values as a function of the quench velocity. Nonequilibrium imaginary-time dynamics is also amenable to quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, with a scheme that we introduce here and apply to quenches of the transverse-field Ising model to quantum-critical points in one and two dimensions. The QMC method is generic and can be applied to a wide range of models and nonequilibrium setups.},

However, the important degrees of freedom may be difficult to identify. Here we demonstrate a machine learning algorithm capable of identifying the relevant degrees of freedom and executing RG steps iteratively without any prior knowledge about the system. We introduce an artificial neural network based on a model-independent, information-theoretic characterization of a real-space RG procedure, performing this task. We apply the algorithm to classical statistical physics problems in one and two dimensions. We demonstrate RG flow and extract the Ising critical exponent. Our results demonstrate that machine learning techniques can extract abstract physical concepts and consequently become an integral part of theory- and model-building.},

With the projection (imaginary) time {$\tau$} scaled as {$\tau$} = aLz , L being the system length and z the dynamic critical exponent (which takes the value z = 1 in the bilayer model studied here), a critical point can be identified which asymptotically flows to the correct location and universality class with increasing L, independently of the prefactor a and the initial state. Varying the proportionality factor a and the initial state only changes the cross-over behavior into the asymptotic large-L behavior. In some cases, choosing an optimal factor a may also lead to the vanishing of the leading finite-size corrections. The observation of typicality can be used to speed up simulations of quantum criticality, not only within the Monte Carlo approach but also with other numerical methods where imaginary-time evolution is employed, e.g., tensor network states, as it is not necessary to evolve fully to the ground state but only for sufficiently long times to reach the typicality regime.},

Since incoherent quantum tunneling is employed by quantum annealers (QAs) to solve optimization problems, this result suggests that there is no quantum advantage in using QAs with respect to quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. A counterexample is the recently introduced shamrock model (Andriyash and Amin, arXiv:1703.09277), where topological obstructions cause an exponential slowdown of the PIMC tunneling dynamics with respect to incoherent quantum tunneling, leaving open the possibility for potential quantum speedup, even for stoquastic models. In this work we investigate the tunneling time of projective QMC simulations based on the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) algorithm without guiding functions, showing that it scales as 1/{$\Delta$}, i.e., even more favorably than the incoherent quantum-tunneling time, both in a simple ferromagnetic system and in the more challenging shamrock model. However, a careful comparison between the DMC ground-state energies and the exact solution available for the transverse-field Ising chain indicates an exponential scaling of the computational cost required to keep a fixed relative error as the system size increases.},

We show that this approach leads to extremely efficient state preparation: for example, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states can be prepared with O(1) iterations of the protocol, and a quantum critical point of the long-range transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) can be prepared with {$>$}99\% fidelity on a 100-qubit system with only one iteration. Furthermore, we show that VQCS with LRIs is a promising route for exploring generic points in the phase diagram of the long-range TFIM. Our approach thus provides concrete, ultrafast protocols for quantum simulators equipped with long-range interactions.},

The Hamiltonian is diagonalized to obtain the lowest energy state using the variational principle within the selected subspace of the basis functions. This method is free from the difficulty known as the negative sign problem. We can optimize a wave function using two procedures. The first procedure is to increase the number of basis functions. The second improves each basis function through the operators e-{$\Delta\tau$}H using the Hubbard-Stratonovich decomposition. We present an algorithm for the quantum Monte Carlo diagonalization method using a genetic algorithm and the renormalization method.

Before the full power of such machines will be available, near-term quantum devices will provide several hundred qubits and limited error correction. Still, there is a realistic prospect to run useful algorithms within the limited circuit depth of such devices. Particularly promising are optimization algorithms that follow a hybrid approach: the aim is to steer a highly entangled state on a quantum system to a target state that minimizes a cost function via variation of some gate parameters. This variational approach can be used both for classical optimization problems as well as for problems in quantum chemistry. The challenge is to converge to the target state given the limited coherence time and connectivity of the qubits. In this context, the quantum volume as a metric to compare the power of near-term quantum devices is discussed. With focus on chemistry applications, a general description of variational algorithms is provided and the mapping from fermions to qubits is explained. Coupled-cluster and heuristic trial wave-functions are considered for efficiently finding molecular ground states. Furthermore, simple error-mitigation schemes are introduced that could improve the accuracy of determining ground-state energies. Advancing these techniques may lead to near-term demonstrations of useful quantum computation with systems containing several hundred qubits.},

In our algorithm, the problem Hamiltonian (oracle) and a transverse field are applied alternately to the system in a periodic manner. We introduce a technique, based on spin-coherent states, to analyze the composite unitary in a single period. This composite unitary drives a closed transition between two states that have high degrees of overlap with the initial state and the target state, respectively. The transition rate in our algorithm is of order {$\Theta$}(1/{$\surd$}N), and the overlaps are of order {$\Theta$}(1), yielding a nearly optimal query complexity of T{$\simeq\surd$}N({$\pi$}/2{$\surd$}2). Our algorithm is a QAOA circuit that demonstrates a quantum advantage with a large number of iterations that is not derived from Trotterization of an adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO) algorithm. It also suggests that the analysis required to understand QAOA circuits involves a very different process from estimating the energy gap of a Hamiltonian in AQO.},

  abstract = {The next few years will be exciting as prototype universal quantum processors emerge, enabling implementation of a wider variety of algorithms. Of particular interest are quantum heuristics, which require experimentation on quantum hardware for their evaluation, and which have the potential to significantly expand the breadth of quantum computing applications. A leading candidate is Farhi et al.'s Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which alternates between applying a cost-function-based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian. Here, we extend this framework to allow alternation between more general families of operators. The essence of this extension, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, is the consideration of general parametrized families of unitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time-evolution under a fixed local Hamiltonian for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz supports the representation of a larger, and potentially more useful, set of states than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a broad array of application areas. For cases that call for mixing only within a desired subspace, refocusing on unitaries rather than Hamiltonians enables more efficiently implementable mixers than was possible in the original framework. Such mixers are particularly useful for optimization problems with hard constraints that must always be satisfied, defining a feasible subspace, and soft constraints whose violation we wish to minimize. More efficient implementation enables earlier experimental exploration of an alternating operator approach to a wide variety of approximate optimization, exact optimization, and sampling problems. Here, we introduce the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, lay out design criteria for mixing operators, detail mappings for eight problems, and provide brief descriptions of mappings for diverse problems.},

We will show that for the Hubbard model the HQMC suffers from ergodicity issues
and unbounded forces in the effective action. Solutions to these issues can be
found in terms of a complexification of the auxiliary fields. This
implementation of the HQMC that does not attempt to regularize the fermionic
matrix so as to circumvent the aforementioned singularities does not outperform
single spin flip determinantal methods with cubic scaling. On the other hand we
will argue that there is a set of models for which the HQMC is very efficient.
This class is characterized by effective actions free of singularities. Using
the Majorana representation, we show that models such as the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian at half filling and on a bipartite lattice
belong to this class. For this specific model sub-cubic scaling is achieved.},

  abstract = {Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) are fast routes to the final results of slow, adiabatic changes of the controlling parameters of a system. The shortcuts are designed by a set of analytical and numerical methods suitable for different systems and conditions. A motivation to apply STA methods to quantum systems is to manipulate them in timescales shorter than decoherence times. Thus shortcuts to adiabaticity have become instrumental in preparing and driving internal and motional states in atomic, molecular, or solid-state physics. Applications range from information transfer and processing based on gates or analog paradigms, to interferometry and metrology. The multiplicity of STA paths for the controlling parameters may be used to enhance robustness versus noise and perturbations, or to optimize relevant variables. Since adiabaticity is a widespread phenomenon, STA methods also extended beyond the quantum world to optical devices, classical mechanical systems, and mechanical engineering or statistical physics. Shortcuts to adiabaticity combine well with other concepts and techniques, in particular with optimal control theory, and pose fundamental scientific and engineering questions such as finding speed limits, quantifying the third principle, or determining process energy costs and efficiencies. We review concepts, methods and applications of shortcuts to adiabaticity and outline promising prospects, as well as open questions and challenges ahead.},

We successfully apply the ansatz on the one- and two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and systematically study its scaling for the one-dimensional model at criticality. We find the total imaginary time required scales logarithmically with system size, in contrast to the linear scaling in conventional quantum Monte Carlo. We suggest this is due to unique dynamics permitted by alternating imaginary-time evolution, including exponential growth of bipartite entanglement. For generic models, the superior scaling of our ansatz potentially mitigates the negative sign problem at the expense of having to optimize variational parameters.},

  abstract = {We compute the electromagnetic self-force acting on a charged particle held in place at a fixed position r outside a five-dimensional black hole described by the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric. Using a spherical-harmonic decomposition of the electrostatic potential and a regularization prescription based on the Hadamard Green's function, we express the self-force as a convergent mode sum. The self-force is first evaluated numerically, and next presented as an analytical expansion in powers of R/r, with R denoting the event-horizon radius. The power series is then summed to yield a closed-form expression. Unlike its four-dimensional version, the self-force features a dependence on a regularization parameter s that can be interpreted as the particle's radius. The self-force is repulsive at large distances, and its behavior is related to a model according to which the force results from a gravitational interaction between the black hole and the distribution of electrostatic field energy attached to the particle. The model, however, is shown to become inadequate as r becomes comparable to R, where the self-force changes sign and becomes attractive. We also calculate the self-force acting on a particle with a scalar charge, which we find to be everywhere attractive. This is to be contrasted with its four-dimensional counterpart, which vanishes at any r.},

Supervised algorithms trained on raw samples of microstates can successfully detect conventional phase transitions via learning a bulk feature such as an order parameter. In this paper, we investigate whether neural networks can learn to classify phases based on topological defects. We address this question on the two-dimensional classical XY model which exhibits a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. We find significant feature engineering of the raw spin states is required to convincingly claim that features of the vortex configurations are responsible for learning the transition temperature. We further show a single-layer network does not correctly classify the phases of the XY model, while a convolutional network easily performs classification by learning the global magnetization. Finally, we design a deep network capable of learning vortices without feature engineering. We demonstrate the detection of vortices does not necessarily result in the best classification accuracy, especially for lattices of less than approximately 1000 spins. For larger systems, it remains a difficult task to learn vortices.},

In addition, we introduce the Variational Quantum Thermalizer (VQT) for generating the thermal state of a given Hamiltonian and target temperature, a task for which QHBMs are naturally well-suited. The VQT can be seen as a generalization of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to thermal states: we show that the VQT converges to the VQE in the zero temperature limit. We provide numerical results demonstrating the efficacy of these techniques in illustrative examples. We use QHBMs and the VQT on Heisenberg spin systems, we apply QHBMs to learn entanglement Hamiltonians and compression codes in simulated free Bosonic systems, and finally we use the VQT to prepare thermal Fermionic Gaussian states for quantum simulation.},

Using a Bayesian topic modeling algorithm, we determine and empirically quantify the topic content of a large collection of 10-K narratives spanning the 1994 to 2012 period. We find that the algorithm produces a valid set of semantically meaningful topics that are predictive of financial misreporting based on samples of SEC enforcement actions (AAERs) and reporting irregularities identified from financial restatements and 10-K filing amendments. Our out-of-sample tests indicate that topic significantly improves the detection of financial misreporting by as much as 59\% when added to models based on commonly-used financial and textual style variables. Furthermore, models that incorporate topic as an additional predictor significantly outperform traditional models when detecting long-duration misreporting events. Taken together, our results suggest that the content of annual report narratives and the attention devoted to each topic are useful signals in detecting financial misreporting.},

We find that quantified principal components from PCA not only allow the exploration of different phases and symmetry-breaking, but they can distinguish phase-transition types and locate critical points. We show that the corresponding weight vectors have a clear physical interpretation, which is particularly interesting in the frustrated models such as the triangular antiferromagnet, where they can point to incipient orders. Unlike the other well-studied models, the properties of the BSI model are less well known. Using both PCA and conventional Monte Carlo analysis, we demonstrate that the BSI model shows an absence of phase transition and macroscopic ground-state degeneracy. The failure to capture the ``charge'' correlations (vorticity) in the BSI model (XY model) from raw spin configurations points to some of the limitations of PCA. Finally, we employ a nonlinear unsupervised machine learning procedure, the ``autoencoder method,'' and we demonstrate that it too can be trained to capture phase transitions and critical points., This article appears in the following collection:},

Here, we propose a neural-network approach to finding phase transitions, based on the performance of a neural network after it is trained with data that are deliberately labelled incorrectly. We demonstrate the success of this method on the topological phase transition in the Kitaev chain2, the thermal phase transition in the classical Ising model3, and the many-body-localization transition in a disordered quantum spin chain4. Our method does not depend on order parameters, knowledge of the topological content of the phases, or any other specifics of the transition at hand.

Despite this curse, the machine learning community has developed techniques with remarkable abilities to recognize, classify, and characterize complex sets of data. Here, we show that modern machine learning architectures, such as fully connected and convolutional neural networks3, can identify phases and phase transitions in a variety of condensed-matter Hamiltonians. Readily programmable through modern software libraries4,5, neural networks can be trained to detect multiple types of order parameter, as well as highly non-trivial states with no conventional order, directly from raw state configurations sampled with Monte Carlo6,7.},

We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.},

The exact criterion used for validation-based early stopping, however, is usually chosen in an ad-hoc fashion or training is stopped interactively. This trick describes how to select a stopping criterion in a systematic fashion; it is a trick for either speeding learning procedures or improving generalization, whichever is more important in the particular situation. An empirical investigation on multi-layer perceptrons shows that there exists a tradeoff between training time and generalization: From the given mix of 1296 training runs using different 12 problems and 24 different network architectures I conclude slower stopping criteria allow for small improvements in generalization (here: about 4\% on average), but cost much more training time (here: about factor 4 longer on average).},

In the context of condensed matter physics, most progress in the field of supervised learning has come from employing neural networks as classifiers. Although very powerful, such algorithms suffer from a lack of interpretability, which is usually desired in scientific applications in order to associate learned features with physical phenomena. In this paper, we explore support vector machines (SVMs), which are a class of supervised kernel methods that provide interpretable decision functions. We find that SVMs can learn the mathematical form of physical discriminators, such as order parameters and Hamiltonian constraints, for a set of two-dimensional spin models: the ferromagnetic Ising model, a conserved-order-parameter Ising model, and the Ising gauge theory. The ability of SVMs to provide interpretable classification highlights their potential for automating feature detection in both synthetic and experimental data sets for condensed matter and other many-body systems.},

In this work, we feed the computer data generated by the classical Monte Carlo simulation for the XY model in frustrated triangular and union jack lattices, which has two order parameters and exhibits two phase transitions. We show that the outputs of the principal component analysis agree very well with our understanding of different orders in different phases, and the temperature dependences of the major components detect the nature and the locations of the phase transitions. Our work offers promise for using machine learning techniques to study sophisticated statistical models, and our results can be further improved by using principal component analysis with kernel tricks and the neural network method.},

In this paper, we apply the finite element method (FEM) to design microstrip transmission lines on silicon substrate for microwave and digital IC in future wireless technology. We mainly focus on computing the capacitance per unit length for two types structures on silicon substrate: a single microstrip on two layer media (oxide and silicon substrate) and another with two microstrips, one microstrip interact in oxide layer and the other on top of the oxide layer all above the silicon substrate. Also, we illustrate the potential distribution of the models.},

The neutral and non-neutral versions of the Coulomb gas are discussed and the relation to an equivalent sine-Gordon field theory is given. The charge-unbinding picture is used to elucidate some essential properties of the Coulomb gas. Derivations of approximate renormalization equations are sketched and the phase transition for the neutral two-dimensional Coulomb gas is described. The Kosterlitz renormalization-group equations are reviewed in some detail. The vortex-Coulomb gas charge analogy is carefully explained. The connections between experiments for 4He films and superconducting films and the neutral and non-neutral versions of the Coulomb gas are outlined using concepts like the universal jump and the Coulomb gas scaling relations. The properties of a dynamical version of the Coulomb gas, corresponding to vortex dynamics, are discussed and related to experiments. An analogy with Maxwell's equations in two dimensions is also given.},

  abstract = {Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained networks by over 90\%, decreasing storage requirements and improving computational performance of inference without compromising accuracy. However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance. We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the "lottery ticket hypothesis:" dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks ("winning tickets") that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective. We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20\% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.},

  abstract = {Pruning is a standard technique for removing unnecessary structure from a neural network to reduce its storage footprint, computational demands, or energy consumption. Pruning can reduce the parameter-counts of many state-of-the-art neural networks by an order of magnitude without compromising accuracy, meaning these networks contain a vast amount of unnecessary structure. In this paper, we study the relationship between pruning and interpretability. Namely, we consider the effect of removing unnecessary structure on the number of hidden units that learn disentangled representations of human-recognizable concepts as identified by network dissection. We aim to evaluate how the interpretability of pruned neural networks changes as they are compressed. We find that pruning has no detrimental effect on this measure of interpretability until so few parameters remain that accuracy beings to drop. Resnet-50 models trained on ImageNet maintain the same number of interpretable concepts and units until more than 90\% of parameters have been pruned.},

  title = {Stabilizing the {{Lottery Ticket Hypothesis}}},
  abstract = {Pruning is a well-established technique for removing unnecessary structure from neural networks after training to improve the performance of inference. Several recent results have explored the possibility of pruning at initialization time to provide similar benefits during training. In particular, the "lottery ticket hypothesis" conjectures that typical neural networks contain small subnetworks that can train to similar accuracy in a commensurate number of steps. The evidence for this claim is that a procedure based on iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) reliably finds such subnetworks retroactively on small vision tasks. However, IMP fails on deeper networks, and proposed methods to prune before training or train pruned networks encounter similar scaling limitations. In this paper, we argue that these efforts have struggled on deeper networks because they have focused on pruning precisely at initialization. We modify IMP to search for subnetworks that could have been obtained by pruning early in training (0.1\% to 7\% through) rather than at iteration 0. With this change, it finds small subnetworks of deeper networks (e.g., 80\% sparsity on Resnet-50) that can complete the training process to match the accuracy of the original network on more challenging tasks (e.g., ImageNet). In situations where IMP fails at iteration 0, the accuracy benefits of delaying pruning accrue rapidly over the earliest iterations of training. To explain these behaviors, we study subnetwork "stability," finding that - as accuracy improves in this fashion - IMP subnetworks train to parameters closer to those of the full network and do so with improved consistency in the face of gradient noise. These results offer new insights into the opportunity to prune large-scale networks early in training and the behaviors underlying the lottery ticket hypothesis.},

  abstract = {The recent "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis" paper by Frankle \& Carbin showed that a simple approach to creating sparse networks (keeping the large weights) results in models that are trainable from scratch, but only when starting from the same initial weights. The performance of these networks often exceeds the performance of the non-sparse base model, but for reasons that were not well understood. In this paper we study the three critical components of the Lottery Ticket (LT) algorithm, showing that each may be varied significantly without impacting the overall results. Ablating these factors leads to new insights for why LT networks perform as well as they do. We show why setting weights to zero is important, how signs are all you need to make the reinitialized network train, and why masking behaves like training. Finally, we discover the existence of Supermasks, masks that can be applied to an untrained, randomly initialized network to produce a model with performance far better than chance (86\% on MNIST, 41\% on CIFAR-10).},
