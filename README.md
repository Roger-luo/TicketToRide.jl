## Lyrics for QHACK presentation

Hello, hello, hello!

It's great to come together, right now, over at Xanadu. 

We're The Day Trippers, and we've spent Yesterday and a Hard day's Night working on our (Quantum Lottery) Ticket to Ride project.

It's been a Long and Winding road, and we could easily work on this for the 8 Days a Week, but we have to Let it be and present our work.

**(Matt Presents)**

It's wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill! We have such a lovely audience.

(*Sing!*)


I think I'm gonna be sad


QHACK's done today


The code that's driving us mad


Is done halfway (not really though)



Ahh we've got a ticket to ride


We've got a ticket to ride


We've got a ticket to ride


It's cool software!


(*Fin*)

### proof of concept
Want $N=12$ and nlayers < 200 with energy (relative) < 1.8%. 
or N=14, 16$ with any number of layers
